{"name":"Champollion","tagline":"Champollion is a Rails engine that allows storing I18n translation in a database.","body":"### Rails I18n Translations with an ActiveRecord backend.\r\nChampollion is a Rails engine that allows storing I18n translation in a database. The engine also integrates with front-end Angular translations by providing a controller action with a json response that a plugin like angular-translate can pick up and use.\r\n\r\n#### Rails 4.2 Installation\r\nAdd the gem in your Gemfile. Note that for now you will have to include the i18n-active_record gem as a dependency in the Rails application because the latest stable gem is on a separate git repository.\r\n\r\n```\r\ngem 'i18n-active_record', :git => 'git://github.com/svenfuchs/i18n-active_record.git', :require => 'i18n/active_record'\r\ngem 'champollion'\r\n```\r\n\r\nMount the engine.\r\n\r\n```\r\nmount Champollion::Engine => '/champollion'\r\n```\r\n\r\nImport migrations in your Rails application\r\n\r\n```\r\nbundle exec rake champollion:install:migrations\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun the migrations\r\n\r\n```\r\nbundle exec rake db:migrate\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Revisions\r\nThis engine uses the paper_trail gem to keep track of translation versions and authors. The default views will show all the revision dates and authors.\r\n\r\nPaper trail will use the current_user variable if available and use it when creating a revision record. Restoring a previous version is not currently implemented.\r\n\r\n#### Angular-translate\r\nWhen you configure your translate provider in Angular set the following configuration options:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$translateProvider.preferredLanguage('en');\r\n$translateProvider.useStaticFilesLoader({\r\n  prefix: '/champollion/translations', // this has to match the endpoint where you mounted the engine.  \r\n  suffix: '.json'    \r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Note\r\nThis gem is still under active development and not production ready.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
